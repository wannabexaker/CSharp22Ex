- **Deadpan humor:** minimal emotion, maximum clarity
- **UTF-8 ready:** supports €, ©, and other civilized symbols
- **Enterprise finale:** multi-layered architecture with full DI setup


## 🛠️ Requirements

- **.NET 8.0 SDK** or newer  
- IDE: Visual Studio 2022+ or VS Code with the C# Dev Kit  


## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the full Visual Studio solution:
CSharp22ExSolution\CSharp22ExSolution.sln

This single solution loads **all 22 C# projects** — each folder (`ex001_...` to `ex022_...`) represents one lesson.

2. To run any specific lesson:
- Right-click its project → **Set as Startup Project**
- Press **F5** or **Ctrl+F5**

3. Or from the terminal:
```bash
cd ex006_LoopsAndIterations
dotnet run
```

## 🙌 Acknowledgment

This project stands on a simple truth: someone has to teach you the foundations before you can build anything worth looking at.  
Credit goes to my C# instructor, **Michail Kasapoglou**, whose lessons shaped the core concepts behind these exercises.

Every example here is rewritten, reorganized, expanded, and explained in my own style —  
but the starting point, the mindset, and the discipline came from his teaching.

Thumbs up. 👍
